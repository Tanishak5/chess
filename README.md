Chess
A python chess game with multi-functional player versus player and minimax ai mode.

# This project helped me develop
- Python OOP skills
- A minimax function with alpha beta pruning
- Design skills

# ðŸŽ“ Learning Journey
- I was inspired by this video :
- Although the video says it produces an ai version, at the time of building this part of the video was not uploaded yet
- So the minimax is entirely mine
- Features I added include: Landing page to chose between modes, A check mate function, restart/exit buttons, caching of the king pos to increase speed of AI
- Changes include: The check function which doesn' use deepcopies since it slows minimax, The check mate which checks for stalemate as well.

# âœ… Minimax Features
- Alpha Beta pruning
- Ordered Moves, before evaluation to ensure best branch found earlier
- Evaluation function with MVV-LVA bonuses, promotion bonuses, attacker penalties.
